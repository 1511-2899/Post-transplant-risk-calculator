# Post-transplant-risk-calculator

A machine learning–based clinical decision-support tool designed to predict the risk of mortality in pediatric bone marrow transplant patients.

This calculator uses patient-specific clinical and laboratory parameters to estimate:

Predicted mortality risk (%)

Risk classification (High vs. Low)
How It Works

Enter patient-specific pre- and post-transplant variables.

The app preprocesses the data and applies a trained Random Forest classifier.

It returns:

Probability of mortality (in %)

Risk category → High or Low

Helps clinicians stratify risk and optimize patient management.
